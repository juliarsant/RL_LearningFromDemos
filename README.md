Human-In-The-Loop Reinforcement Learning
By: Julia Santaniello

This program runs a vanilla Policy Gradient algorithm, and a modified HITL PG algorithm to learn Lunar Lander.

Be prepared to Press "Enter" and play Lunar Lander if demonstrating. Lunar Lander has 4 discrete actions: Up, Down, Left-Engine, Right-Engine. These will be the respective arrow keys.

TO RUN:
python3 main.py

Make sure you have "run_all" set to True for the first time. This will allow you to run demonstrations, HITL-PG and PG training at once.

"Human"= True will allow you to only run HITL-PG

Anything else will run a normal Policy Gradient training on Lunar Lander.

imports.py should have all necessary variables that can be adjusted.

Software:
Python 3.8.5
Anaconda 
Numpy
Pandas
OpenAi Gymnasium
matplotlib.pyplot
